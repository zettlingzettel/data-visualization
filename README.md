# Netflix shows with 50mln+ views
Graph 12
<br />
Summary:
<br />
This chart shows the top Netflix titles with over 50 million views and highlights whether the title was available globally.
The top five shows—all have over 100 million views and are all marked as Available Globally (green/blue bars). This demonstrates that the highest-tier viewership on the platform requires the addressable market of all Netflix subscribers.
<br />
The Single Most Dominant Hit: The spike in late 2021represents the unprecedented, massive viewership of Squid Game.
<br />
Looking past the Squid Game anomaly, there are noticeable clusters of high-volume releases.
<br />
The most recent data (2023 to mid-2025) shows a continued pattern of high peaks and deep valleys. This indicates that Netflix is not generating a constant stream of 50M+ view hits, but rather is strategically deploying major releases every few months to capture attention, followed by periods where high-volume hits are more scarce.

# Long Beach Animal Shelter Analysis
Graph 10
<br />
Dataset: [GitHub](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/main/data/2025/2025-03-04/readme.md)
<br />
Summary:
<br />
The animal shelter processed a total of 51,514 intakes and outcomes, with cats and dogs making up the vast majority, primarily arriving in "Normal" condition, and the most common positive outcomes being "Rescue" and "Adoption."
<br />
<br />
The vast majority of animals arrive in stable condition, but "Under Age/Weight" is the second-largest specific concern. The "Normal" intake condition is by far the highest count (over 20k), but the second-largest specific condition is "Under Age/Weight," with a count of over 10k, suggesting a significant portion of the shelter's resources are dedicated to caring for juvenile or malnourished animals.
<br />
<br />
The combined total of positive outcomes significantly outweighs negative ones. The top three positive outcomes (Rescue, Adoption, and Return to Owner) collectively represent a higher volume than the top negative/neutral outcomes (Euthanasia, Transfer, and Shelter, Neuter, Return), indicating an overall high success rate in moving animals out of the shelter via desirable means.
