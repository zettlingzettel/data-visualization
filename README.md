# Long Beach Animal Shelter Analysis
Graph 10
<br />
Dataset: [GitHub](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/main/data/2025/2025-03-04/readme.md)
<br />
Summary:
<br />
The animal shelter processed a total of 51,514 intakes and outcomes, with cats and dogs making up the vast majority, primarily arriving in "Normal" condition, and the most common positive outcomes being "Rescue" and "Adoption."
<br />
<br />
The vast majority of animals arrive in stable condition, but "Under Age/Weight" is the second-largest specific concern. The "Normal" intake condition is by far the highest count (over 20k), but the second-largest specific condition is "Under Age/Weight," with a count of over 10k, suggesting a significant portion of the shelter's resources are dedicated to caring for juvenile or malnourished animals.
<br />
<br />
The combined total of positive outcomes significantly outweighs negative ones. The top three positive outcomes (Rescue, Adoption, and Return to Owner) collectively represent a higher volume than the top negative/neutral outcomes (Euthanasia, Transfer, and Shelter, Neuter, Return), indicating an overall high success rate in moving animals out of the shelter via desirable means.
